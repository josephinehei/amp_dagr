This application uses maps to tell the user the coordinates on the location they wish to visit. It also has a tab with instructions on how to load a radio and get the Zulu time. These are common uses that Army Soldiers use their Defense Advanced GPS Receiver(DAGR) for and is meant to be easier to use than the DAGR.
